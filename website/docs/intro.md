React NodeGui Testing Library provides utilities for testing applications using
[React NodeGui](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui).

## The problem

You want to write maintainable tests for your [React
NodeGui](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui) components testing without
implementation details and rather focus on making your tests give you the
confidence for which they are intended.

## This solution

The `react-nodegui-testing-library` is a very lightweight solution for testing
React NodeGui components. It provides light utility functions on top of
`react-test-renderer`, in a way that encourages better testing practices.

The project is heavily based on [`react-native-testing-library`](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library)
